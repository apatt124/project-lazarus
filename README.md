# Project Lazarus

Personal medical record management system. Building an AI assistant to help organize, search, and understand my own medical documents (lab results, visit notes, prescriptions, imaging reports). The system stores documents securely in my private AWS account and uses AI to provide conversational access to my health information. This is for personal use only to better manage my own healthcare data.

## Overview

Project Lazarus is a conversational AI assistant for managing personal medical records. Upload any medical document (PDFs, images, screenshots) and chat with an AI that understands your health history.

### Key Features

- 🤖 **Conversational AI** - Natural language chat powered by Claude (Anthropic)
- 📄 **Universal File Support** - Upload PDFs, images, screenshots with automatic OCR
- 🔍 **Semantic Search** - Find information by meaning, not just keywords
- 🔒 **Private & Secure** - Your data stays in your own AWS account
- 💰 **Cost-Effective** - ~$15-20/month for complete infrastructure
- 🎨 **Modern UI** - Clean, Gemini-inspired interface with dark mode

```

### Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- React 18
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript

**Backend:**
- AWS Lambda (Python 3.12)
- PostgreSQL 15 with pgvector
- AWS S3 (encrypted storage)

**AI/ML:**
- Claude 3 Haiku (Anthropic via AWS Bedrock)

- AWS Textract (OCR)

## Features

### 1. Conversational AI Chat

Ask questions in natural language:
- "What's my blood pressure?"
- "Summarize my medical history"
- "What were my MRI results?"
- "How do you work?" (self-aware!)

### 2. Universal File Upload

Supports any medical document format:
- PDFs (machine-readable and scanned)
- Images (PNG, JPG, screenshots)
- Automatic text extraction with OCR
- AI-powered metadata detection

### 3. Semantic Search

Find information by meaning:
- Vector embeddings (1024 dimensions)
- Similarity-based retrieval
- Context-aware results

### 4. Smart Features

- **Duplicate Detection** - SHA-256 content hashing
- **Auto-metadata Extraction** - AI detects provider, date, type
- **Multi-theme Support** - 8 color themes including dark mode
- **Mobile-Friendly** - Responsive design

## Usage

### Upload Documents

1. Click "Upload Document" button
2. Drag and drop or select file
3. AI automatically detects metadata
4. Review and upload

### Chat with Your Records

1. Type a question in the chat
2. AI searches your documents
3. Get conversational, context-aware answers
4. See source documents with similarity scores

### Helper Scripts

```bash
# Test AI access
./scripts/test-bedrock.sh

# Test vector search
./scripts/test-search.sh "blood pressure"

# Test chat
./scripts/test-chat.sh "What's in my records?"

# Database queries
./scripts/db-query.sh count

# View logs
./scripts/logs.sh

# Check costs
./scripts/check-costs.sh
```

## Cost Breakdown

**Monthly Infrastructure:**
- RDS PostgreSQL: ~$13
- Lambda: ~$0.50
- S3 Storage: ~$0.50
- Bedrock AI: ~$1-5 (usage-based)

**Total: $15-20/month**

Per-document costs:
- Upload with AI analysis: ~$0.002
- Chat query: ~$0.01
- OCR (if needed): ~$0.0015

## Security

- ✅ All data encrypted at rest (S3, RDS)
- ✅ Encrypted in transit (TLS)
- ✅ Private VPC for database
- ✅ IAM role-based access
- ✅ No data leaves your AWS account
- ✅ Secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager

```

## Troubleshooting

See `docs/troubleshooting.md` for common issues and solutions.

**Common Issues:**
- Claude access denied → See `ENABLE-CLAUDE-ACCESS.md`
- Search returns no results → Check similarity threshold
- Upload fails → Verify IAM permissions
- Database connection fails → Check RDS security groups
